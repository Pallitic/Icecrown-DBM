4/22/2021: This update is useful specially for frostmourne players.

Naxx: Yoinked timers from frostmourne dbm. Added alot of TTS

Ulduar: Exactly like Naxx fixed timers and TTS

Toc: Added TTS. timers were mostly accurate

Icc: added/changed alot of voice announcements. Fixed most of the overlaps. removed a few useless stuff

i wont mention uld and naxx TTS 1by1, but the voice announcements should cover most of the major mechanics. i will keep updating them after their releases on frostmourne.

Todo:
1. Fix every current timer, you can help me too by telling me whats wrong or use this dbm and stream your raid on twitch
2. Add some more useful TTS calls, feel free to contact me for requests
