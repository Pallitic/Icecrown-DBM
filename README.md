Todo:

1. Fix every current function/timer, you can help me too by telling me whats not working/wrong or using this dbm and stream your Light of dawn or halion 25 hc run on twitch
2. Add some more useful TTS calls, feel free to contact me for requests
3. Fix the overlaps all together by shortening some TTS files
